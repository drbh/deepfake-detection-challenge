| 2018 | Deepfake Video Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks | "This paper proposes a temporal-aware pipeline to automatically detect deepfake videos. Our system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract frame-level features.
These features are then used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns to classify if a video has been subject to manipulation or not." | D Güera, EJ Delp | https://engineering.purdue.edu/~dgueraco/content/deepfake.pdf |
