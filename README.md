## Current Research

| Year | Title | Summary | Author | Link |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ---- |
| 2018 | Deepfake Video Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks | "This paper proposes a temporal-aware pipeline to automatically detect deepfake videos. Our system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract frame-level features. These features are then used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns to classify if a video has been subject to manipulation or not." | D Güera, EJ Delp (Purdue) | [pdf](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~dgueraco/content/deepfake.pdf) |
| 13 Nov 2018 | EXPOSING DEEP FAKES USING INCONSISTENT HEAD POSES | "Our method is based on the observations that Deep Fakes are created by splicing synthesized face region into the original image, and in doing so, introducing errors that can be revealed when 3D head poses are estimated from the face images. We perform experiments to demonstrate this phenomenon and further develop a classification method based on this cue. Using features based on this cue, an SVM classifier is evaluated using a set of real face images and Deep Fakes." | Xin Yang?
, Yuezun Li? and Siwei Lyu (NYU) | [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00661) | 
| August 2018 | Detection of Deepfake Video Manipulation | "photo response non uniformity (PRNU) analysis is tested for its effectiveness at detecting Deepfake video manipulation. The PRNU analysis shows a significant difference in mean normalised cross correlation scores between authentic videos and Deepfakes." | Marissa Koopman, Andrea Macarulla Rodriguez, Zeno Geradts (University of Amsterdam & Netherlands Forensic Institute) | [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zeno_Geradts/publication/329814168_Detection_of_Deepfake_Video_Manipulation/links/5c1bdf7da6fdccfc705da03e/Detection-of-Deepfake-Video-Manipulation.pdf)
